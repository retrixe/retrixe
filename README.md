### Hey there o/

I'm a student in 12th grade, with years of experience working on many different projects.

- 🎆 I have in-depth experience using JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, React (Native) and associated tools like Babel and webpack), Java (not with major frameworks, although I once used Spring), and Kotlin to some extent. Familiar with Python and Golang (a particular favourite of mine). I've used MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB and Redis and I'm definitely interested in using more like Cassandra, PostgreSQL and Elastisearch in the future. I've worked with a variety of technologies and read about many more, so this is by no means an exhaustive list.
- 🐧 I'm highly experienced with using Linux and system administration (tools like systemd, package management with apt/rpm, repairing broken systems, livepatch/kpatch, maintenance, system partitioning, MySQL, MariaDB, nginx, etc).
- 🔍 I'm really good at googling and following the xkcd tech support cheat sheet.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [octyne](https://github.com/retrixe/octyne)/[ecthelion](https://github.com/retrixe/ecthelion) (process manager with an HTTP API/dashboard), EnderChat (a modern React Native rewrite of ChatCraft), [writer](https://github.com/retrixe/writer) (GUI app to flash ISOs), [modpack](https://github.com/retrixe/modpack) (an installer for my personal Fabric mods), [Area51](https://github.com/retrixe/area51) (serve files over HTTP), [bug-tracker](https://github.com/retrixe/bug-tracker) (a GitHub issues clone), [coupe-video](https://github.com/retrixe/coupe-video) (website to cut videos with your CPU, no watermarks or uploading), and last but not least, extensive work on [MythicMC](https://github.com/mythicmc) including a custom [store](https://store.mythicmc.org) and many plugins in Java/Kotlin. [You can find my GitLab for fun projects as well.](https://gitlab.com/retrixe) This isn't an exhaustive list, I work on many projects in my spare time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OpenGL and getting more familiar with C++.
- 🎓 I'm currently dealing with preparing for the SAT, looking up colleges and considering the MongoDB certification exam.
- 📰 I've previously worked on [ez.chat (could restart in free time)](https://github.com/ezchat), [decaffeinater](https://github.com/retrixe/decaffeinater), reconsole and electron-installer-linux.
- 💬 Ask me about anything I know! I'm sure I can help you out and point you in the right direction, from hardware and software issues to programming problems, especially with languages I know, and otherwise having read about many different technologies.

- ⚡ Fun fact: Samsung is currently ~20% of South Korea’s GDP.
- 🐛 Good tip: Minimise external dependencies in your projects.
