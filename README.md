### Hey there o/

I'm in 11th grade right now, moving into 12th and working on many different projects.

- 🎆 I have in-depth experience using JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, React (Native) and associated tools like Babel and webpack), Java (not with major frameworks, although I once used Spring), and Kotlin to some extent. Familiar with Python and Golang (a particular favourite of mine). I've used MySQL/MariaDB, MongoDB and Redis and I'm definitely interested in using more like Cassandra, PostgreSQL and Elastisearch in the future. I've worked with a variety of technologies and read about many more, so this is by no means an exhaustive list.
- 🐧 I'm highly experienced with using Linux and system administration (tools like systemd, package management with apt/rpm, repairing broken systems, livepatch/kpatch, maintenance, system partitioning, MySQL, MariaDB, nginx, etc).
- 🔍 I'm really good at googling and following xkcd tech support cheat sheet.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning OpenGL and getting more familiar with C++.
- 🎓 I'm currently dealing with preparing for the SAT, looking up colleges and considering the MongoDB certification exam.
- 📰 I've previously worked on...
