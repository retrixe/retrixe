### Hey there o/

I'm a student at MIT World Peace University, with years of experience working on many different projects. Formerly worked full-time at Apconic Software Pvt Ltd for a year, and in my spare time, I work on multiple open-source projects.

- 🎆 I have in-depth experience using JavaScript (TypeScript, Node.js, React, React Native and associated tools like Babel and webpack), Java, Kotlin and Golang (a personal favourite). I'm also familiar with using MySQL/MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and Redis. I've worked with and studied many more technologies, so this is hardly an exhaustive list.
- 🐧 I'm highly experienced with using Linux and system administration (tools like systemd, package management with apt/rpm, repairing broken systems, livepatch/kpatch, maintenance, system partitioning, database setup, nginx, etc).
- 🔍 I'm really good at googling and following the xkcd tech support cheat sheet.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on:
  - [EnderChat](https://github.com/retrixe/EnderChat) (a modern React Native rewrite of ChatCraft)
  - [octyne](https://github.com/retrixe/octyne)/[ecthelion](https://github.com/retrixe/ecthelion) (a process manager with a web dashboard)
  - [imprint](https://github.com/retrixe/imprint) (GUI app to flash ISOs)
  - [concinnity](https://github.com/retrixe/concinnity) (watch videos together)
  - [IveBot](https://github.com/retrixe/IveBot) (a Discord bot for random things)
  - Extensive work on [MythicMC](https://github.com/mythicmc) including a custom [store](https://store.mythicmc.org) and many plugins in Java/Kotlin.
  - [You can find my GitLab for fun projects as well.](https://gitlab.com/retrixe)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write a programming language and getting more familiar with C++ and Rust.
- 🎓 I'm currently studying a bachelor's degree in Computer Science at MIT World Peace University.
- 📰 I've previously worked on [modpack](https://github.com/retrixe/modpack), [bug-tracker](https://github.com/retrixe/bug-tracker), [coupe-video](https://github.com/retrixe/coupe-video), [cerulean](https://github.com/cerulean-app), [ez.chat](https://github.com/ezchat), [Area51](https://github.com/retrixe/area51), [decaffeinater](https://github.com/retrixe/decaffeinater) and reconsole.
- 💬 Ask me about anything I know! I'm sure I can help you out and point you in the right direction, from hardware and software issues to programming problems, especially with languages I know, and otherwise having read about many different technologies.
