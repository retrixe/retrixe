    <h4>TODO</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Implement counter+speedrun AI: check if the second player is winning, if they are, then
        counter and block; else look for lines which are closest to completion, rank them (by how
        much is left to complete them, but perhaps other criteria to make it smarter like a move
        which the player would be unable to counter), and then try completing the most eligible one
      </li>
      <li>
        a more advanced ai could replace the else strategy with ahead prediction like chess AIs,
        test all moves, rank each possible move with the best likelihood to win
      </li>
    </ul>
